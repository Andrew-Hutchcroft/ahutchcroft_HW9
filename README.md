- I created a web form that asks BAIS students about their experience within the major. It included various questions that will help the BAIS department with their research.

22b:

- This web form conforms to best practices for forms in a multitude of ways. First, the start survey button is easily accessible and visible, it is not hard to view. The text on the index.html slide is large, but not too large, and is easy to read without an overbaring amount of text. On the 1st page of the survey, there is an autofocus that takes your cursor to the first line of the survey, so that you do not have to click it yourself. Next, you cannot complete the survey without filling in all of the necessary questions. If you try to continue on the survey without answering a question, it will not let you advance

- The web form also tells you what page you are currently on. At the bottom of the page there is a footer that says "page 1 of 2" or "page 2 of 2" so you understand where you are at in the survey. Additionally, there is a back button that you can utilize incase you messed up a question on the previous page and want to fix it. The drop downs in the survey are also user friendly, as they are large enough for people to read. This goes for all of the text in the form, it is large enough to read but not over barring in any way on any of the pages. There is also a tooltip incase someone did not understand one of the questions, and this allows the user to understand what the question is specifically referring to without having to do this in the question.

- There is also different types of drop downs, check boxes, and radio buttons used. This is useful so the user does not get confused what is being asked of them. Lastly, there is a "submit" button and a thank you page so that the user understands when the survey has concluded. The picture also has a description incase someone is blind and cannot see the image.

22c:

- The first thing I did to make the web form accessible to all users was make it accessible on a computer and a phone. The page adjusts with what size you want it to be so regardless of the device you are using, you can access the survey. The next thing is I made the colors of this survey basic and not over barring, so those with bad eye sight do not have any problems with the survey. I also made all of the text large so it is easy to see, as well as providing a tooltip incase a user is confused about the question that is being asked of them. Lastly, for those who are blind, I gave the image a description so that they are able to understand what the image is even though they cannot see it.
